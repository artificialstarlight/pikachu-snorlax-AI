# pikachu-snorlax-AI
Python AI to determine if an image is of Pikachu or Snorlax from Pokemon.


Train the AI on the images of Pikachu and Snorlax, then give it a new image it hasn't seen before. It will try to determine whether the image is of Pikachu, Snorlax, or neither.

Written from scratch in Python 3 as an excersize to help learn more about AI and machine learning and how it works.


# How to use it:

Run the .py file with a parameter of the image you want to give it. Make sure the training images (pikachu1.jpg, pickachu2.jpg...snorlax3.jpg) are in the same path as the .py file.

It may not be correct all the time.
